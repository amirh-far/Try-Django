Hey there People!
I'm currently working on this course which is teaching me Django framework 
You can search this course by simply searching django 3.2 in google
By now I've reached to the end of 24th video that creates a login view to authenticate users.
I hope I will finish this course by the end of September or even sooner.
Happy coding :)
