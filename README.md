# Try-Django-3.2
Hey there People!\n
I'm currently working on this course which is teaching me Django framework <br>
You can search this course by simply searching django 3.2 in google <br>
By now I've reached to the end of 24th video that creates a login view to authenticate users. <br>
I hope I will finish this course by the end of September or even sooner. <br>
Happy coding :)
